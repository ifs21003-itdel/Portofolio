                                Levelearn is a mobile-based learning application developed as part of my 
                                final research project in collaboration with a team. It functions as a 
                                digital platform for IT Del students, providing access to various courses 
                                through three main features: learning materials, assessments, and assignment 
                                submissions. I worked on developing the RESTful API using Node.js with the 
                                Express.js framework, while coordinating closely with my teammates who handled the 
                                mobile development. The backend is integrated with a MongoDB database via Prisma 
                                ORM for streamlined data management, and Supabase is used for storing course-related 
                                files such as assignments and images

                                Academy 2024 Independent Study program. HerbalEase is an application for information
                                 about herbal plants. In this application, users can search for information about 
                                 herbal plants, search for the right herbal plants for a disease, identify herbal 
                                 plants through images, discussions, and so on. This application is built using the 
                                 Kotlin programming language which is integrated with API. However, this project did 
                                 not have time to be integrated with a machine learning model for identifying herbal 
                                 plant images because the model was not ready to use by the specified deadline.

                                at the Del Institute of Technology. In this web application, users will be provided 
                                with information about lecturers, the number of active students, alumni, study program 
                                profiles, and so on. The web is built using the PHP programming language and using the 
                                Laravel 9 framework. In this project, all group members are given the same role where 
                                each member gets a role in creating designs, designing databases, developing web applications, 
                                and so on..

                                SoChat is a simple communication application between users 
                                individually or in a group. This application is based on 
                                Client/Server Socket Programming which uses the Java programming 
                                language and applies the TCP communication protocol for private 
                                communication and the UDP communication protocol for group communication.
                                 This application uses a database to store user account data.

                                Timetable is a simple application created using the Java programming 
                                language which is intended to fulfill the project assignments for 
                                the object-based programming course. This application is also combined 
                                with a SQL database using RDBMS Mariadb. Application creation was carried 
                                out using the Netbeans IDE.
